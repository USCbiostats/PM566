# Exploratory Data Analysis

* Exploratory data analysis is the process of summarizing data
* It should be the first step in your analysis pipeline
* It involves:
  + checking data (import issues, outliers, missing values, data errors)
  + cleaning data
  + summary statistics of key variables (univariate and bivariate)
  + basic plots and graphs

# Pipeline

EDA involves Import -> Tidy -> Transform -> Visualize. Basically it is everything before we do modeling, prediction or inference.

# EDA Checklist

The goal of EDA is to better understand your data. Let's use the **checklist**:

  1. Formulate a question
  2. Read in the data
  3. Check the dimensions and headers and footers of the data
  4. Check the variable types in the data
  5. Take a closer look at some/all of the variables
  6. Validate with an external source
  7. Conduct some summary statistics to answer the initial question
  8. Make exploratory graphs

---
# Case study

We are going to use a dataset created from the National Center for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/). The data are 2019 hourly measurements from weather stations across the continental U.S.
---

# Formulate a Question

* It is a good idea to first have a question such as:
--

  + what weather stations reported the hottest and coldest temperatures? 
  + what are the summary statistics of the continuous variables in my dataset (mean, variance)?
  + is there covariation between two variables in my dataset?

---

# Read in the Data

There are several ways to read in data (some depend on the type of data you have):

* read.table() or read.csv() in base R for delimited files
* readRDS if you have an R dataset
* read_csv, read_csv2, read_delim, read_fwf from library(readr) that is part of the tidyverse
* readxl() from library(readxl) for .xls and .xlsx files
* read_sas, read_spss, read_stata from library(haven)
* fread from data.table() for efficiently importing large datasets that are regular delimited files
---

# Read in the Data

Let's load the libraries we need to read in the data:
```{r}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
```
---

# Check the data

---

# Check variables

---
# Check variables more closely

---

# Validate against an external source

---

# Summary statistics

---
#Exploratory Graphs

* With exploratory graphs we aim to:

--

  + debug any issues remaining in the data
  + understand properties of the data
  + look for patterns in the data
  + inform modeling strategies
