<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Exploratory data analysis is the process of becoming familiar with a dataset</li>
<li>It should be the first step in your analysis pipeline</li>
<li>It involves:
<ul>
<li>checking data (import issues, outliers, missing values, data errors)</li>
<li>cleaning data</li>
<li>summary statistics of key variables (univariate and bivariate)</li>
<li>basic plots and graphs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="exploratory-data-analysis-1" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Since our eyes and brains are not wired to detect patterns in large data tables filled with text and numbers, communication about data […] rarely comes in the form of raw data or code output. Instead, data and data-driven results are usually either summarized (e.g., using an average/mean) and presented in small summary tables or they are presented visually in the form of graphs, in which shape, distance, color, and size can be used to represent the magnitudes of (and relationships between) the values within our data.</p>

<h2>The Tidyverse Model</h2>

<img data-src="img/tidy_pipeline.png" class="r-stretch"><p>Loosely, EDA encompasses the Import -&gt; Tidy -&gt; Transform -&gt; Visualize steps. Basically it is everything before we do modeling, prediction or inference.</p>
<p>EDA may involve some statistical summaries, but it does <em>not</em> include formal statistical analysis.</p>
</section>
<section id="eda-checklist" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>EDA Checklist</h2>
<p>The goal of EDA is to better understand your data. Let’s use the <strong>checklist</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Read in the data</li>
<li>Check the size of the data</li>
<li>Examine the variables and their types</li>
<li>Look at the top and bottom of the data</li>
<li>Visualize the distributions of key variables</li>
<li>Check your expectations</li>
<li>Validate with an external source</li>
<li>Formulate a (simple) question</li>
<li>Try the easy solution first</li>
<li>Challenge your solution</li>

<section id="case-study" class="slide level2">
<h2>Case study</h2>
<p>We are going to use a dataset created from the National Center for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/). The data are 2019 hourly measurements from weather stations across the continental U.S.</p>

<img data-src="img/weather.png" class="r-stretch"></section>
<section id="formulate-a-question" class="slide level2">
<h2>Formulate a Question</h2>
<p>It is a good idea to first have a question such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which weather stations reported the hottest and coldest daily temperatures?</li>
<li>What day of the month was on average the hottest?</li>
<li>Is there correlation between temperature and humidity in my dataset?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="read-in-the-data" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Read in the Data</h2>
<p>There are several ways to read in data (some depend on the type of data you have):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>read.table</code> or <code>read.csv</code> in base R for delimited files</li>
<li><code>readRDS</code> if you have a .rds dataset (this is a handy, compressed way of saving R objects)</li>
<li><code>read_csv</code>, <code>read_csv2</code>, <code>read_delim</code>, <code>read_fwf</code> from <code>library(readr)</code> that is part of the tidyverse</li>
<li><code>readxl()</code> from <code>library(readxl)</code> for .xls and .xlsx files</li>
<li><code>read_sas</code>, <code>read_spss</code>, <code>read_stata</code> from <code>library(haven)</code></li>
<li><code>fread</code> from <code>library(data.table)</code> for efficiently importing large datasets that are regular delimited files</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="read-in-the-data-1" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Read in the Data</h2>
<p>There are plenty of ways to do these tasks, but we will focus on base R.</p>
<p>Since our data is stored as a (gzipped) CSV file, we could load it into R with <code>read.csv</code>, but we will use the more flexible <code>read.table</code>. I have it stored locally, but we will see how to load it straight from GitHub in the lab.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a></a>met <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read.table</span>(<span class="st">'../data/met_all.gz'</span>,</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a></a>                  <span class="at">header =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>, <span class="at">sep =</span> <span class="st">','</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>We specify that the first line contains column names by setting <code>header = TRUE</code> and we indicate that commas are used to separate the different values (rather than tabs, spaces, etc.) by setting <code>sep = ','</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="working-with-data.frames" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Working with <code>data.frame</code>s</h2>
<p>This gave as a <code>data.frame</code> object, which is a standard R format for cleaned, rectangular data. Each row represents an observation and each column represents a variable.</p>
<p>As we have seen, you can access particular parts of the <code>data.frame</code> by subsetting with the square brackets, <code>[,]</code>. For example, you can pull out the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th elements of the 1st column of our <code>met</code> dataset with <code>met[2:4, 1]</code>.</p>
<p>You can also pull out specific columns by name, using the <code>$</code> operator. Since the first column is called <code>USAFID</code>, we could access the same subset as above with <code>met$USAFID[2:4]</code> (notice that there is no comma here, because we have already subset down to a single variable).</p>
<p>To see the list of names for the dataset, you can use <code>names(met)</code> or <code>colnames(met)</code>. To see the top few rows of the dataset, use <code>head(met)</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="check-the-data" class="slide level2">
<h2>Check the data</h2>
<p>We should check the dimensions of the data set. This can be done several ways:</p>

<h2>Check the data</h2>
<ul>
<li>We see that there are 2,377,343 records of hourly temperature in August 2019 from all of the weather stations in the US. The data set has 30 variables.</li>
<li>We should also check the top and bottom of the dataset to check for any irregularities. Use <code>head(met)</code> and <code>tail(met)</code> for this.</li>
<li>Next we can take a deeper dive into the contents of the data with <code>str()</code></li>

<h2>Data cleaning</h2>
<p>If we return to our initial question (“Which weather stations reported the hottest and coldest daily temperatures?”), we need to generate a list of weather stations that are ordered from highest to lowest. We can then examine the top and bottom of this new dataset.</p>
<p>First let us remove the aberrant observations and then we’ll sort by temperature.</p>

</div>
<p>Notice that we do not create a new object, we just overwrite the <code>met</code> object. Once you’re sure that you want to remove certain observations, this is a good way to avoid confusion (otherwise, it is easy to end up with multiple subsets of the data in your R environment with similar names like <code>met</code>, <code>met_ss</code>, <code>met_ss2</code>, <code>met_final</code>, <code>met_FINAL</code>, <code>met_FINAL_REAL</code>, etc.)</p>

<section id="data-cleaning-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Data cleaning</h2>
<p>We will also remove any observations with missing temperature values (<code>NA</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>is.na()</code> function tells you whether or not a particular value is missing and the <code>!</code> operator takes the opposite of a <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> value, so in combination, they tell you which observations are not missing.</p>

<h2>Summary statistics</h2>
<p>We need to transform our data to answer our initial question. Let’s find the <strong>daily</strong> mean, max, and min temperatures for each weather station in our <code>data.frame</code>. We can do this with the <code>summarize</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package. This package is part of the <code>tidyverse</code>, so the syntax is a bit different from what we’ve seen before.</p>

<p>What we’ve done here is told R to summarize the <code>met</code> dataset by the variables <code>USAFID</code> and <code>day</code>, splitting the data into subsets based on those two indexing variables. For each subset (representing a specific station of a specific day), we want the daily average temperature, as well as latitude, longitude, and elevation (though hopefully those don’t change too much over the course of a day!)</p>

<section id="summary-statistics-2" class="slide level2">

<p>Before we continue, check the relative sizes of the <code>met</code> and <code>met_daily</code> objects. Which one is bigger?</p>
