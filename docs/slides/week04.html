<img data-src="img/ggplot2.png" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center r-stretch" style="width:25.0%"><p>This lecture provides an introduction to ggplot2, an R package that provides vastly better graphics options than R’s default plots, histograms, etc.</p>

<li>Layers are added to <code>ggplot()</code> with <code>+</code></li>
<li>Layers include <code>geom</code> functions such as point, lines, etc</li>
<li>Each <code>geom</code> function takes a <code>mapping</code> argument, which is always paired with <code>aes()</code></li>

<h2>Basic Scatterplot 2</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>geom_point()</code> adds a layer of points to your plot, to create a scatterplot.</li>
<li><code>ggplot2</code> comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot.</li>
<li>Each geom function in <code>ggplot2</code> takes a mapping argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties.</li>
<li>The mapping argument is always paired with <code>aes()</code>, and the x and y arguments of <code>aes()</code> specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variables in the data argument, in this case, met_avg</li>
<li>One common problem when creating ggplot2 graphics is to put the <code>+</code> in the wrong place: it has to come at the end of the line, not the start.</li>

<p>The best way to get a comprehensive overview is the ggplot2 cheatsheet, which you can find at https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf</p>
