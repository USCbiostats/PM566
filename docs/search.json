Students may discuss the problems with one another, however, individual solutions must be submitted and copying will not be tolerated.\nStudents may earn extra credit on Homework by submitting their own data visualization for the weekly Tidy Tuesday dataset presented in class. Each week, a student can earn 5 points of extra credit, up to a total of 50 for the semester (equivalent to half of one homework assignment).\nMidterm Project: The midterm project will be to perform a thorough exploratory analysis and write a report with preliminary findings using a real-world dataset of your choosing. The source code and PDF report will be uploaded to GitHub.\nFinal Project: The final project will be to write a report for an analysis applied to a real-world dataset of your choosing and to create a website that includes interactive visualizations to display the data and results. The source code, website files, and PDF report will be uploaded to GitHub."

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThe University of Southern California is foremost a learning community committed to fostering successful scholars and researchers dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas. Academic misconduct is in contrast to the university’s mission to educate students through a broad array of first-rank academic, professional, and extracurricular programs and includes any act of dishonesty in the submission of academic work (either in draft or final form).\nThis course will follow the expectations for academic integrity as stated in the USC Student Handbook. All students are expected to submit assignments that are original work and prepared specifically for the course/section in this academic term. You may not submit work written by others or “recycle” work prepared for other courses without obtaining written permission from the instructor(s). Students suspected of engaging in academic misconduct will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity.\nOther violations of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication (e.g., falsifying data), knowingly assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty, and any act that gains or is intended to gain an unfair academic advantage.\nThe impact of academic dishonesty is far-reaching and is considered a serious offense against the university and could result in outcomes such as failure on the assignment, failure in the course, suspension, or even expulsion from the university.\nFor more information about academic integrity see the student handbook or the Office of Academic Integrity’s website, and university policies on Research and Scholarship Misconduct.\n\nStatement on the use of Artificial Intelligence\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) may be used under the direction and rules specified by the course instructor in specific circumstances as outlined in the syllabus. The student is responsible for the quality and content of all written assignments. Unless otherwise indicated by the course instructor, generative AI may be used to create an initial literature review, document outline and/or to organize material toward a first draft of a class paper, proofreading, or grammatical accuracy; however the final content of the written document and critical thinking of the ideas presented in the document must represent the student’s individual work and ideas learned through course content and/or research conducted from sources outside of the generative AI system. The student must include an annotation on all materials submitted that explicitly documents how AI was used to generate the document and properly reference both the sources and the AI tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023). The student must review the information in the document and edit for accuracy, completeness, proper grammar, and demonstrate that the wording accurately reflects the student’s understanding and purpose in writing the text. Students should be aware that text generated solely from AI generators may include factual errors, bias, and may contain incomplete or inaccurate reference information, in addition to furthering appropriating knowledge produced by historically marginalized scholars without proper crediting. If you have any questions on whether a specific AI tool is allowed for any aspect of your work in this class, please ask your instructor for guidance. Failure to ensure agreement with your instructor on use of AI, prior to doing so, may result in a zero score. (NOTE: instructors have sophisticated tools to determine AI plagiarism.)"

The Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) is responsible for the determination of appropriate accommodations for students who encounter disability-related barriers. Once a student has completed the OSAS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and accommodations are determined to be reasonable and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be available to generate for each course. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive. More information can be found at http://osas.usc.edu. You may contact OSAS at (213) 740-0776 or via email at osasfrontdesk@usc.edu."

From the bottom up:\n\nThread level SIMD instructions: Most modern processors support some level of what is called vectorization, this is, applying a single (same) instruction to streams of data. For example: adding vector A and B.\nHyper-Threading Technology (HTT): Intel’s hyper-threading generates a virtual partition of a single core (processor) which, while not equivalent to having multiple physical threads, does speed things up.\nMulti-core processor: Most modern CPUs (Central Processing Unit) have two or more physical cores. A typical laptop computer has about 8 cores.\nGeneral-Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Unit (GP-GPU): While modern CPUs have multiple cores, GPUs can hold thousands of cores. Designed for image processing, there’s an increasing use of GPUs as an alternative to CPUs for scientific computing."

    "text": "In this lab, you are expected to learn/put in practice the following skills:\n\nEvaluate whether a problem can be parallelized or not.\nPractice with the parallel package.\n\n\n\nThe following functions can be written to be more efficient without using parallelization. Write a faster version of each function and show that (1) the outputs are the same as the slow version, and (2) your version is faster.\n\nThis function generates an n x k dataset with all its entries drawn from a Poission distribution with mean lambda.\n\n\nfun1 &lt;- function(n = 100, k = 4, lambda = 4) {\n  x &lt;- NULL\n  \n  for (i in 1:n){\n    x &lt;- rbind(x, rpois(k, lambda))    \n  }\n  \n  return(x)\n}\n\nfun1alt &lt;- function(n = 100, k = 4, lambda = 4) {\n  # YOUR CODE HERE\n}\n\nShow that fun1alt generates a matrix with the same dimensions as fun1 and that the values inside the two matrices follow similar distributions. Then check the speed of the two functions with the following code:\n\n# Benchmarking\nmicrobenchmark::microbenchmark(\n  fun1(),\n  fun1alt()\n)\n\n\nThis function finds the maximum value of each column of a matrix.\n\n\n# Data Generating Process (10 x 10,000 matrix)\nset.seed(1234)\nx &lt;- matrix(rnorm(1e4), nrow=10)\n\n# Find each column's max value\nfun2 &lt;- function(x) {\n  apply(x, 2, max)\n}\n\nfun2alt &lt;- function(x) {\n  # YOUR CODE HERE\n}\n\nShow that both functions return the same output for a given input matrix, x. Then check the speed of the two functions, as you did above.\n\n\n\nWe will now turn our attention to the statistical concept of bootstrapping. Among its many uses, non-parametric bootstrapping allows us to obtain confidence intervals for parameter estimates without relying on parametric assumptions.

    "text": "Learning Goals\n\nRead in and get familiar with the meteorology dataset\n\nStep through the EDA “checklist” presented in the class slides\nPractice making exploratory graphs\n\nAs you do this, think about what questions you would like to ask regarding this data. What would you ask a collaborator who was more familiar with it?\n\n\nLab Description\nWe will work with the meteorological data presented in lecture. Recall the dataset consists of weather station readings in the continental US.\nThe objective of the lab is to find the weather station with the highest elevation and look at patterns in the time series of its wind speed and temperature.\n\n\nSteps\n\n1. Read in the data\nThe data for this lab is available at https://github.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/tree/master/02_met. There’s some additional information about the dataset, but the main file you’ll need to download is met_all.gz.\nOnce you’ve downloaded the file, you can read it into R with:\n\nmet &lt;- read.csv(\"~/Downloads/met_all.gz\")\n\n\n\n2. Check the dimensions, headers, footers\n\nHow many columns, rows are there?\n\n\ndim(met)\nhead(met)\ntail(met)\n\n\n\n3. Take a look at the variables.\n\nstr(met)\n\n\n\n4. Take a closer look at the key variables.\n\ntable(met$year)\ntable(met$day)\ntable(met$hour)\nsummary(met$temp)\nsummary(met$elev)\nsummary(met$wind.sp)\n\nIt looks like the elevation variable has observations with 9999.0, which is probably an indicator for missing. We should take a deeper look at the data dictionary to confirm. The wind speed variable is OK but there are a lot of missing data.\nAfter checking the data we should make the appropriate modifications. Replace elevations with 9999 as NA.\n\nmet[met$elev==9999.0] &lt;- NA\nsummary(met$elev)\n\n\nAt what elevation is the highest weather station?\n\nWe also have the issue of the minimum temperature being -40C, so we should remove those observations.\n\nmet &lt;- met[temp&gt;-40]\nmet2 &lt;- met[order(temp)]\nhead(met2)\n\nWe again notice that there is a -17.2C temperature reading that seems suspicious.\n\n\n5. Check the data against an external data source.\nWe should check the suspicious temperature value (where is it located?) and validate that the range of elevations make sense (-13 m to 4113 m).\nGoogle is your friend here.\nFix any problems that arise in your checks.\n\nmet &lt;- met[temp&gt;-15]\nmet2 &lt;- met[order(temp)]\nhead(met2)\n\n\nSummarize that we removed temperatures colder than -15C. The new dataset has a minimum temp of -3C, which is reasonable.\n\n\n\n6. Calculate summary statistics\nRemember to keep the initial question in mind. We want to pick out the weather station with maximum elevation and examine its windspeed and temperature.\nSome ideas: select the weather station with maximum elevation; look at the correlation between temperature and wind speed; look at the correlation between temperature and wind speed with hour and day of the month.\n\nelev &lt;- met[elev==max(elev), ]\nsummary(elev)\n\n\ncor(elev$temp, elev$wind.sp, use=\"complete\")\ncor(elev$temp, elev$hour, use=\"complete\")\ncor(elev$wind.sp, elev$day, use=\"complete\")\ncor(elev$wind.sp, elev$hour, use=\"complete\")\ncor(elev$temp, elev$day, use=\"complete\")\n\n\n\n7. Exploratory graphs\nWe should look at the distributions of all of the key variables to make sure there are no remaining issues with the data.\n\nhist(met$elev, breaks=100)\nhist(met$temp)\nhist(met$wind.sp)\n\nOne thing we should consider for later analyses is to log transform wind speed and elevation as they are very skewed.\nLook at where the weather station with highest elevation is located.\n\nleaflet(elev) %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles('OpenStreetMap') %&gt;% \n  addCircles(lat=~lat,lng=~lon, opacity=1, fillOpacity=1, radius=100)\n\nLook at the time series of temperature and wind speed at this location. For this we will need to create a date-time variable for the x-axis.\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\nelev$date &lt;- with(elev, ymd_h(paste(year, month, day, hour, sep= ' ')))\nsummary(elev$date)\nelev &lt;- elev[order(date)]\nhead(elev)\n\nWith the date-time variable we can plot the time series of temperature and wind speed.\n\nplot(elev$date, elev$temp, type='l')\nplot(elev$date, elev$wind.sp, type='l')\n\n\nSummarize any trends that you see in these time series plots.\n\n\n\n8. Ask questions\nBy now, you might have some specific questions about how the data was gathered and what some of the different variables and values mean. Alternatively, maybe you have an idea for how some of the variable should be related and you want to explore that relationship. In a real-world analysis, these questions could potentially be answered by a collaborator, who may have been part of the team that collected the data. What questions do you have about the data?\nIf you haven’t already, now would be a good time to look at the accompanying data dictionary for this dataset and see if it can answer any of your questions. If you have questions about the nature of the dataset and how it was gathered, this might be able to help.\nFor questions about variables in the dataset or relationships between them, try making some more exploratory plots. Do you see the patterns you would expect? There are many different types of summaries and visualization strategies that we have not discussed, but which could provide interesting perspectives on the data.\nSome other useful plotting functions include: - pairs for making all pairwise scatter plots in a dataset with &gt;2 dimensions. - heatmap and/or corrplot (from the corrplot package) for visualizing matrices in general or correlation matrices in particular. - image a low-level matrix visualization function - barplot, especially with table, for visualizing frequencies of categorical variables."

If you don’t do this, Quarto will often create a separate directory (called &lt;document&gt;_files) that contains these images and your output will depend on this outside directory.\nWhen you’re done, click “Render” to compile the document."

Add your responses to your lab report, with relevant code in the associated R code chunk, and free-form text outside of the code chunk.\n\nLet’s take a look at what these datasets are. To start, we can make a frequency table of the dataset variable:\n\ntable(datasaurus_dozen$dataset)\n\nHere, we used the $ operator to access a specific column (variable) of the dataset. Then we used the table function to summarize that variable. table is great for quickly summarizing categorical variables, but it’s not very useful for summarizing continuous variables, where most unique values are only present once. For continuous variables, try the summary function.\nThe original Datasaurus (dino) was created by Alberto Cairo in this great blog post. The other Dozen were generated using simulated annealing and the process is described in the paper Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice. In the paper, the authors simulate a variety of datasets with the same summary statistics as the Datasaurus, but with very different distributions."

    "text": "Question 2\n\nPlot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for just this dataset.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Quarto document and successfully Render it and view the results.\nWe’re going to start by subsetting our data down to just the dino dataset.\n\nSubsetting\n\ndino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen[datasaurus_dozen$dataset == 'dino', ]\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nThe first thing to note is the assignment operator: &lt;-. This special symbol is used to create a new object or assign a new value to an existing one. In this case, we’re creating a new object called dino_data.\nThe second important feature is the set of square brackets: []. When these come immediately after the name of an object, they are used for subsetting that object, or taking a smaller piece of it. In this case, we want to subset the datasaurus_dozen object. Since this is a two-dimensional data.frame, we can subset it by either rows or columns, or both. The comma (,) separates our row subset from our column subset. In this case, we only want to subset by row and keep all the columns, so there is nothing after the comma.\nIn R (as in Python and many other programming languages), we can check whether or not two values are equal by using the == operator. Here, we again use the $ to access the dataset variable and we check if it is equal to the value 'dino'. If it is, this comparison will return TRUE and we will keep that row. If it isn’t, this comparison will return FALSE and we will not keep that row.\n\n\nPlotting\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the plot function for this, which is R’s most basic plotting function. If you provide the plot function with two numeric vectors, it will plot them in a scatter plot. Let’s see what happens when we plot the x and y variables from our dino_data object:\n\nplot(dino_data$x, dino_data$y)\n# ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n#   geom_point()\n\n(I’ve also included code for producing similar plots using the ggplot function from the ggplot2 package. This is another widely-used plotting function that includes some more aesthetically pleasing defaults, but requires more complicated syntax)\nWe will talk a lot more about the philosophy of data visualization, how to choose the right plot type, and constructing visualizations in layers in the coming weeks. But for now, you can follow along with the code that is provided.\nFor the second part of these exercises, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear – it’s dinosaurial!\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let’s calculate correlation coefficient between x and y. Like plot, the cor function takes two numeric variables and calculates their correlation coefficient:\n\ncor(dino_data$x, dino_data$y)\n# dino_data |&gt;\n#   summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n(I’ve also included the “tidyverse” way of calculating this value. The “tidyverse” is a collection of packages that includes ggplot2 and is based on the concept of “tidy”, rectangular datasets. We will tend to focus on the “Base R” way of doing things, as learning the “tidyverse” coding style is almost like learning another language in addition to R)"

    "text": "Question 5\nNow let’s plot all 13 datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of the layout function. This function allows you to put multiple plots in the same plotting window. We will create a 4x4 matrix containing the values 1 through 16 and pass this to layout, which lets it know where we want each plot to go (we only have 13 datasets, so there will be a few empty spots at the end). This may be too many plots for a small viewing window, so if you get the error message Error in plot.new() : figure margins too large, try making your plotting window larger.\nThen we use a for loop to perform a set of actions over every unique value of the dataset variable. This creates a new object, called name, that takes on each of those unique values, but it only exists within the context (interior) of the loop. Then we subset and plot the data, as we have before.\n\nlayout(matrix(1:16, nrow=4, ncol=4))\nfor(name in unique(datasaurus_dozen$dataset)){\n  subset &lt;- datasaurus_dozen[datasaurus_dozen$dataset == name, ]\n  plot(subset$x, subset$y, main = name)\n}\nlayout(1)\n\n\n# ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+\n#   geom_point()+\n#   facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n#   theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nThe second call to layout will reset the plotting window, so that the next plot will take up the entire window, rather than 1/16th of it.\nOptional:If you really want to maximize the plotting area of this figure, you can also adjust the plotting margins via the par function (short for “graphical parameters”). The setting for margins is called mar and it takes a vector of length 4, specifying the bottom, left, top, and right margins, in order (the units are lines of text). You can set each margin to a value of 2 with par(mar = c(2,2,2,2)) and then reset to the default values with par(mar = c(5,4,4,2) + 0.1)."

Click on the gear icon in the top right of a code chunk and select “Use custom figure size” in the pop-up menu. Set the height and width of the figures and hit Apply when done. Then, render your document and see how you like the new sizes. Try making the plot for Question 5 larger, until you are happy with its size. Note that changing the figure sizes added new options to these chunks: fig.width and fig.height. You can change them by defining different values directly in your Quarto document as well.\nChange the look of your report:\nIf you have time, you can explore the different ways you can add styling to your document.

    "text": "Due Date\nThis assignment is due by 11:59pm Pacific Time on Friday, September 26th, 2025.\n\n\nLearning Goals\n\nDownload, read, and get familiar with an external dataset.\nStep through the EDA “checklist” presented in class\nPractice making exploratory plots\n\n\n\nAssignment Description\nWe will work with air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA has a national monitoring network of air pollution sites that measure particulate matter (PM) concentrations. A primer on particulate matter air pollution can be found here.\nThe primary question you will answer is whether daily concentrations of PM\\(_{2.5}\\) (particulate matter air pollution with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \\(\\mu\\)m) decreased in California over the 20 years spanning from 2002 to 2022.\nYour assignment should be completed in Quarto and all code should be included.\n\n\nSteps\n\n(30 points) Given the formulated question from the assignment description, you will now conduct EDA Checklist items 1-5. First, download 2002 and 2022 data for all sites in California from the EPA Air Quality Data website, then read the data into R. For each of the two datasets, check the dimensions, headers, footers, variable names and variable types. Check the distribution of the key variable we are analyzing (PM\\(_{2.5}\\)). Write up a summary of all of your findings.\n(10 points) Combine the two years of data into one data frame. Use the Date variable to create a new column for year, which will serve as an identifier. Change the names of the key variables so that they are easier to refer to in your code.\n(20 points) Create a basic map (or maps) in leaflet showing the locations of the monitoring sites, using different colors for each year. Summarize the spatial distribution of the sites. Does this distribution change from 2002 to 2022?\n(10 points) Check for any data issues such as missing or implausible values of PM\\(_{2.5}\\) in the combined dataset. Calculate the proportion of missing/implausible values for each year and report any temporal patterns you see in these observations.\n(30 points) Explore the main question of interest at three different levels of spatial resolution. Create data visualizations (e.g. boxplots, histograms, line plots, violin plots) and summary statistics that best suit each level of the analysis. Be sure to write up explanations of what you observe at each level.\n\n\nLevel 1: State. Examine the primary question for the entire state.\nLevel 2: County. Examine the primary question for every county in California.\nLevel 3: City. Restrict the data to sites in Los Angeles county and examine the primary question for every site.\n\nReminder: after you upload your final rendered document to GitHub, you should download it to make sure that it looks right! If you haven’t included embed-resources: true in the YAML header, none of your figures will show up!\n\nThis homework has been adapted from the case study in Roger Peng’s Exploratory Data Analysis with R"

    "text": "Due Sunday, October 26th, 2024 by 11:59pm Pacific Time.\nLearning Objective: To apply the skills learned in PM 566 (through Week 6) by analyzing and interpreting a dataset of your choice.\nNarrative: As we have discussed in class, the practice of data science requires both quantitative skills and qualitative knowledge of the domain from which the data was collected. The first step in any data analysis is to have a dataset for which you have formulated an interesting question. If you do not have a dataset to work with, you may choose one from our list of suggestions. With your dataset, formulate a clear and concise question to answer and conduct data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization to explore/answer this question.\nDeliverable: A written report generated in Quarto (HTML or PDF) with embedded tables and figures that is submitted to a project-specific GitHub repository that you create. The report should have the following sections:\n\nIntroduction - provide background on your dataset and formulated question\nData Preparation - how and where the data were acquired, how you cleaned and wrangled the data\nExploratory Analysis - dataset characteristics, variables included, distribution of key variables\nPreliminary Results - analysis of the primary research question and any subsequent follow-up questions, including summary statistics in tabular form and publication-quality figures (look at the kable() function from knitr for making nice tables)\na brief Conclusion - summary of what you found in the data\n\nIn your report, please do not include any unformatted text output (e.g. output from head(), str(), print(), etc.). You should summarize these aspects of your data within the text, figures, and/or tables.\nNote that you cannot use the same dataset on both the Midterm and Final. So if you came into this class with a dataset that you wanted to analyze, you may want to save that for later."

A few examples:\n\ntime: Could be date, date + time, or a combination of both. Usually it has a reference number defined as date 0. In R, the Date class has as reference 1970-01-01, in other words, “days since January 1st, 1970”.\ncategorical: Commonly used to represent strata/levels of variables, e.g. a variable “country” could be represented as a factor, where the data is stored as numbers but has a label.\nordinal: Similar to factor, but it has ordering, e.g. “satisfaction level: 5 very satisfied, …, 1 very unsatisfied”.\n\nOther special data types could be ways to represent missings (usually described as na or NA), or special numeric types, e.g. +-Inf and Undefined (NaN).\nWhen storing/sharing datasets, it is a good practice to do it along a dictionary describing each column data type/format."

Consider this a “brute force” approach. Vectorized methods will always be faster, but these can be easier to conceptualize and, in rare cases, may be the only option.\nConsider the problem creating a weird variable: wind.temp. This will take on 4 possible values, based on the temperature and wind speed: cool & still, cool & windy, warm & still, or warm & windy. We will split each variable based on their median value. Note that this code is too slow to actually run on this large dataset."

For example, an initial set of files is “revision 1”. When the first change is made, the resulting set is “revision 2”, and so on.

Install directly with xcode-select --install, or just try to use e.g. git from the terminal and have OS X prompt you to install the tools.\nHomebrew package manager. A convenient way to install several of the tools here, including Emacs and Pandoc.\nR. A platform for statistical computing.\nPython and SciPy. Python is a general-purpose programming language increasingly used in data manipulation and analysis.\nRStudio. An IDE for R. The most straightforward way to get into using R and RMarkdown.\nTeX and LaTeX. A typesetting and document preparation system. You can write files in .tex format directly, but it is more useful to just have it available in the background for other tools to use. The MacTeX Distribution is the one to install for macOS.\nPandoc. Converts plain-text documents to and from a wide variety of formats. Can be installed with Homebrew. Be sure to also install pandoc-citeproc for processing citations and bibliographies, and pandoc-crossref for producing cross-references and labels.\nGit. Version control system. Installs with Apple’s Developer Tools, or get the latest version via Homebrew.\nGitHub. Host public Git repositories for free. Pay to host private ones. Also a source for publicly available code (e.g. R packages and utilities) written by other people.\nGNU Make. You tell make what the steps are to create the pieces of a document or program. As you edit and change the various pieces, it automatically figures out which pieces need to be updated and recompiled, and issues the commands to do that. See Karl Broman’s Minimal Make for a short introduction. Make will be installed automatically with Apple’s developer tools.\nlintr and flycheck. Tools that nudge you to write neater code.\nZotero. A citation manager that incorporates PDF storage, annotation, and other features. Zotero is free to use and can export to BibTeX/BibLaTeX files."
