## Text Mining

We have a USCbiostats repository for storing data called `data-science-data`.
Navigate to the page for dataset `03_pubmed`
(<https://github.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/tree/master/03_pubmed>) and
download the `pubmed.csv` dataset. This dataset contains 3,241 abstracts from
articles collected via 5 PubMed searches. The search terms are listed in the
second column, `term` and these will serve as the "documents." Your job is to
analyze these abstracts to find interesting insights.

1. (15 points) How many abstracts are associated with each search term? Tokenize
the abstracts and count the number of each token. Do you see anything
interesting? What are the 5 most common tokens for each search term?

2. (15 points) Does removing stop words change what tokens appear as the
most frequent? What are the 5 most common tokens for each search term after
removing stop words?

3. (10 points) Tokenize the abstracts into bigrams. Find the 10 most common
bigrams and visualize them.

<!--# look at bigrams were at least one word is not a stop word -->

4. (20 points) Calculate the TF-IDF value for each word-search term combination
(here you want the search term to be the "document"). What are the 5 tokens from
each search term with the highest TF-IDF value? How are the results different
from the answers you got in Question 1?

## Sentiment Analysis

5. (20 points) Perform a sentiment analysis using the NRC lexicon. What is the
most common sentiment for each search term? What if you remove `"positive"` and
`"negative"` from the list?

6. (20 points) Now perform a sentiment analysis using the AFINN lexicon to get
an average positivity score for each abstract (hint: you may want to create a
variable that indexes, or counts, the abstracts). Create a visualization that
shows these scores grouped by search term. Are any search terms noticeably
different from the others?
